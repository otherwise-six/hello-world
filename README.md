# hello-world
Testing to kickstart my brain into remembering how all this works.

I went to school for computer science but now I live in Japan teaching English. It's not what I expected to do in life but it's been pretty fun, although it's caused my coding skills to degrade horribly and I'd like to start getting back into it. I'm hoping to still get a job in the tech field one day so I gotta keep the rust off, you know?
